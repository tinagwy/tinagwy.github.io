description: "Welcome to my homepage! I am a statistician and a collaborative interdisciplinary researcher, currently serving as an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](https://math.charlotte.edu/), and affiliated with the [School of Data Science](https://sds.charlotte.edu/). Before joining UNC Charlotte, I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from Virginia Tech, under the supervision of [Dr. Inyoung Kim](https://sites.google.com/vt.edu/inyoungk/home), and then gained experiences as a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University, under [Dr. Jeff Miller](https://jwmi.github.io/). My research focuses on developing functional clustering methods through nonparametric Bayesian approach. I am also fascinated by the convergence of classical statistical methodologies with deep learning techniques. Besides methodology development, I have interdisciplinary collaborations in various fields, including city resilience, crowd wisdom, deep-sea creature studies, genetics and genomics, and a variety of other biomedical applications."
